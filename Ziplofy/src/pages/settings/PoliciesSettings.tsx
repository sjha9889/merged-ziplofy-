You'll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.\n\nTo start a return, you can contact us at developer200419@gmail.com. Please note that returns will need to be sent to the following address: [INSERT RETURN ADDRESS]\n\nIf your return is accepted, we'll send you a return shipping label, as well as instructions on how and where to send your package. Items sent back to us without first requesting a return will not be accepted.\n\nYou can always contact us for any return question at developer200419@gmail.com.\n\n\n\n\nDamages and issues\nPlease inspect your order upon reception and contact us immediately if the item is defective, damaged or if you receive the wrong item, so that we can evaluate the issue and make it right.\n\n\n\n\nExceptions / non-returnable items\nCertain types of items cannot be returned, like perishable goods (such as food, flowers, or plants), custom products (such as special orders or personalized items), and personal care goods (such as beauty products). We also do not accept returns for hazardous materials, flammable liquids, or gases. Please get in touch if you have questions or concerns about your specific item.\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot accept returns on sale items or gift cards.\n\n\n\n\nExchanges\nThe fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the item you have, and once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase for the new item.\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Union 14 day cooling off period\nNotwithstanding the above, if the merchandise is being shipped into the European Union, you have the right to cancel or return your order within 14 days, for any reason and without a justification. As above, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging. You'll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.\n\n\n\n\nRefunds\nWe will notify you once we've received and inspected your return, and let you know if the refund was approved or not. If approved, you'll be automatically refunded on your original payment method within 10 business days. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card company to process and post the refund too.\nIf more than 15 business days have passed since we've approved your return, please contact us at developer200419@gmail.com.`;

You represent and warrant that all the information you provide in our stores is correct, current and complete and that you have all rights necessary to provide this information.\nYou are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials and for all of your account activity. You may not transfer, sell, assign, or license your account to any other person.\n\nSECTION 2 - OUR PRODUCTS\nWe have made every effort to provide an accurate representation of our products and services in our online stores. However, please note that colors or product appearance may differ from how they may appear on your screen due to the type of device you use to access the store and your device settings and configuration.\nWe do not warrant that the appearance or quality of any products or services purchased by you will meet your expectations or be the same as depicted or rendered in our online stores.\nAll descriptions of products are subject to change at any time without notice at our sole discretion. We reserve the right to discontinue any product at any time and may limit the quantities of any products that we offer to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction, on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSECTION 3 - ORDERS\nWhen you place an order, you are making an offer to purchase. ${storeName} reserves the right to accept or decline your order for any reason at its discretion. Your order is not accepted until ${storeName} confirms acceptance. We must receive and process your payment before your order is accepted. Please review your order carefully before submitting, as ${storeName} may be unable to accommodate cancellation requests after an order is accepted. In the event that we do not accept, make a change to, or cancel an order, we will attempt to notify you by contacting the e‑mail, billing address, and/or phone number provided at the time the order was made.\nYour purchases are subject to return or exchange solely in accordance with our Refund Policy [LINK].\nYou represent and warrant that your purchases are for your own personal or household use and not for commercial resale or export.\n\nSECTION 4 - PRICES AND BILLING\nPrices, discounts and promotions are subject to change without notice. The price charged for a product or service will be the price in effect at the time the order is placed and will be set out in your order confirmation email. Unless otherwise expressly stated, posted prices do not include taxes, shipping, handling, customs or import charges.\nPrices posted in our online stores may be different from prices offered in physical stores or in online or other stores operated by third parties. We may offer, from time to time, promotions on the Services that may affect pricing and that are governed by terms and conditions separate from these Terms. If there is a conflict between the terms for a promotion and these Terms, the promotion terms will govern.\nYou agree to provide current, complete and accurate purchase, payment and account information for all purchases made at our stores. You agree to promptly update your account and other information, including your email address, credit card numbers and expiration dates, so that we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed.\nYou represent and warrant that (i) the credit card information you provide is true, correct, and complete, (ii) you are duly authorized to use such credit card for the purchase, (iii) charges incurred by you will be honored by your credit card company, and (iv) you will pay charges incurred by you at the posted prices, including shipping and handling charges and all applicable taxes, if any.\n\nSECTION 5 - SHIPPING AND DELIVERY\nWe are not liable for shipping and delivery delays. All delivery times are estimates only and are not guaranteed. We are not responsible for delays caused by shipping carriers, customs processing, or events outside our control. Once we transfer products to the carrier, title and risk of loss passes to you.\n\nSECTION 6 - INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nOur Services, including but not limited to all trademarks, brands, text, displays, images, graphics, product reviews, video, and audio, and the design, selection, and arrangement thereof, are owned by ${storeName}, its affiliates or licensors and are protected by U.S. and foreign patent, copyright and other intellectual property laws.\nThese Terms permit you to use the Services for your personal, non-commercial use only.

Unauthorized use of the Services may be a violation of federal and state intellectual property laws. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by ${storeName}.\n${storeName}'s names, logos, product and service names, designs, and slogans are trademarks of ${storeName} or its affiliates or licensors.

All other names, logos, product and service names, designs, and slogans on the Services are the trademarks of their respective owners.\n\nSECTION 7 - OPTIONAL TOOLS\nYou may be provided with access to customer tools offered by third parties as part of the Services, which we neither monitor nor have any control nor input.\nYou acknowledge and agree that we provide access to such tools "as is" and "as available" without any warranties, representations or conditions of any kind and without any endorsement.
